This repository is created to publish solidity contract and maintain history of changes.

Solidity is a statically-typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the EVM.[14][15] Solidity is compiled to bytecode that is executable on the EVM. With Solidity, developers are able to write applications that implement self-enforcing business logic embodied in smart contracts, leaving a non-repudiable and authoritative record of transactions.

Solidity is a contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts.[1] It is used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms.

you program on Ethereum, a blockchain-based virtual machine that allows the creation and execution of smart contracts,
without needing centralized or trusted parties.

Solidity is a statically typed, contract programming language that has similarities to Javascript. Like objects in OOP, each contract contains state variables, functions, and common data types. Contract-specific features include modifier (guard) clauses, event notifiers for listeners, and custom global variables.
